Provides a test harness for the EC2 plugin.  Provides a new cloud type 
called 'AmazonEC2CloudTester', which drives the AmazonEC2Cloud cloud, but
using a dummy ('mock') EC2 cloud.  The virtual slaves created can actually
run jobs.  The virtual slaves run on a host of your choosing, which you
specify through the 'hostname for EC2 slave simulator' parameter, on the 
'configure' page.
